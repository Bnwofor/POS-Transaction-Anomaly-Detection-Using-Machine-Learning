POS Transaction Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to detect unusual transaction patterns in payment terminal data. The goal is to demonstrate how data science can support transaction monitoring, operational efficiency, and data driven decision-making in digital banking environments.

The dataset used simulates real-world electronic payment transactions, allowing the model to identify patterns that deviate from normal transactional behavior.

Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis on transactional datasets

Prepare and scale numerical features for modeling

Apply unsupervised machine learning for anomaly detection

Evaluate model performance against known anomalies

Visualize results to support business interpretation

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning Approach

The project uses Isolation Forest, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm designed to identify rare or unusual observations within large datasets.

Steps that i used to perform this task

Data loading and inspection

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature scaling and preprocessing

Isolation Forest model training

Prediction of anomalous transactions

Model evaluation using confusion matrix and classification metrics

Key Insights

Transaction datasets are highly imbalanced, with anomalies representing a very small proportion of activity

Scaling features improves anomaly detection performance

Isolation Forest effectively identifies abnormal transaction patterns without requiring labeled training data

Business Relevance

This project demonstrates how machine learning can support

Transaction monitoring

Payment system optimization

Detection of unusual usage patterns

Data-driven operational decision-making

Such techniques are applicable in fintech, banking analytics, and digital payment ecosystems.
